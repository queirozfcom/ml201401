========

 Little ML (Machine Learning) toolkit with utilities and some data for testing as well.
 
 This includes some helpers to manipulate files, clean data and so on.
 
###TODO
  - Unit test functions using sample files.

 
**P.S.:** This is a WIP (work in progress). Keep in mind that I had no prior Python experience before doing this. One of the aims of this project is precisely to get me some Python experience.
