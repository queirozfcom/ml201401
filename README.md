========

 Little ML (Machine Learning) toolkit with utilities and some data for testing as well.
 
 This includes some helpers to manipulate files, clean data and so on.
 
###TODO
  - Unit test functions using sample files.
  - Update the line count function to try and guess whether some lines are headers (shouldn't count) (or else modify the partitioner to disregard lines that look like Headers). I think that one way to spot headers would be to look for lines where all attributes are strings

 
**P.S.:** This is a WIP (work in progress). Keep in mind that I had no prior Python experience before doing this. One of the aims of this project is precisely to get me some Python experience.
